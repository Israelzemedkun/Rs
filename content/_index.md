        My research focuses on utilizing data science, remote sensing, and machine learning to address environmental and policy challenges. As a Remote Sensing Research Assistant at Ashoka University, I developed machine learning models for vegetation and air pollution detection using satellite data, refining methodologies and enhancing model accuracy.


        During my externship with the National Geographic Society and The Nature Conservancy, I conducted landscape and gap analysis for freshwater conservation projects. I am passionate about exploring the intersection of technology and environmental sustainability and am always open to collaboration and discussion on my work. Please feel free to reach out. ðŸ˜ƒ
