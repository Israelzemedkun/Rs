## 1. Introduction

### Background
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a groundbreaking development in the field of machine learning since their introduction by Ian Goodfellow and colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two competing neural networks, known as the generator and the discriminator, that engage in a dynamic adversarial process. The generator creates synthetic data samples that mimic real data, while the discriminator evaluates these samples against actual data, providing feedback to the generator. This competition drives the generator to produce increasingly realistic data, making GANs exceptionally powerful for tasks such as image generation, data augmentation, and creating realistic simulations.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The significance of GANs extends beyond academic interest, influencing practical applications across various domains. In computer vision, GANs have been utilized for image super-resolution, inpainting, and style transfer. In healthcare, GANs assist in generating synthetic medical data to augment training datasets, thereby enhancing diagnostic models. GANs also contribute to advancements in natural language processing by generating text and improving translation systems. The versatility and potential of GANs underscore their importance in advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning.

### Objectives
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The primary objective of this project is to build a GAN using PyTorch to generate realistic images from the MNIST dataset. Specific goals include:
1. Understanding and implementing the basic architecture of GANs.
2. Training the GAN model on the MNIST dataset.
3. Evaluating the performance of the GAN and generating new, unseen data samples.

### Research Questions
1. How effectively can a GAN generate realistic images from the MNIST dataset?
2. What are the challenges faced during the training of a GAN?
3. How can the performance of the GAN be measured and improved?


## 2. Literature Review

### Review Related Work

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been a focal point of research since their inception, leading to numerous advancements and variations. The original GAN model proposed by Goodfellow et al. (2014) faced challenges such as training instability and mode collapse. Subsequent research has aimed to address these issues through various modifications and improvements.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One notable advancement is the Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) introduced by Radford, Metz, and Chintala (2015). DCGANs leverage convolutional layers to improve the stability and quality of generated images, particularly in tasks involving image synthesis. The introduction of convolutional layers allowed for deeper architectures and more complex representations, significantly enhancing the capability of GANs in generating high-resolution images.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another significant development is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) proposed by Arjovsky, Chintala, and Bottou (2017). WGAN addresses the issue of training stability by using the Earth Mover’s distance (or Wasserstein distance) as a metric, which provides smoother gradients compared to the original GAN formulation. This approach mitigates mode collapse and improves the convergence behavior during training.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Conditional GANs (CGANs), introduced by Mirza and Osindero (2014), extend the GAN framework by conditioning both the generator and discriminator on additional information such as class labels. This allows for more controlled and specific generation of data, enabling applications in tasks that require generating data with particular attributes or categories.

### Identify Gaps
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Despite significant advancements, several challenges persist in the effective training and application of GANs. One major challenge is the instability of GAN training, which can result in the generator producing poor-quality or repetitive samples. Mode collapse, where the generator produces a limited variety of outputs, remains a critical issue. Additionally, GANs are highly sensitive to hyperparameter settings, requiring careful tuning to achieve optimal performance.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This project aims to explore these challenges within the context of the MNIST dataset. By implementing and training a GAN using PyTorch, this work seeks to contribute insights into effective GAN training practices and potential solutions to common problems such as training instability and mode collapse. The insights gained from this project could inform future research and applications of GANs in more complex and diverse datasets.

## 3. Methodology
#### Architecture and Configuration

<p style="text-align: justify;">
1. Data Preparation: The MNIST dataset, consisting of grayscale images of handwritten digits, is used for training. Images are augmented through random rotations to enhance model robustness.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
2. Network Design:
    - Discriminator: Utilizes three convolutional layers with batch normalization and LeakyReLU activation functions to distinguish between real and fake images. The final layer outputs a single value indicating the probability of an image being real.
    - Generator: Features four transposed convolutional layers to upsample random noise into images resembling the MNIST dataset. Batch normalization and ReLU activation functions are applied, with the final layer using Tanh activation to ensure output image values are in the range [-1, 1].
Initialization and Optimization:

<p style="text-align: justify;">
3. Network weights are initialized using a normal distribution to stabilize training. The Discriminator and Generator are optimized using the Adam optimizer with specific learning rates and beta values.
4. Loss Functions: Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits Loss is employed to compute the loss for both real and fake images, guiding the networks in distinguishing genuine data from generated data.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
5. Training Loop:The GAN is trained over multiple epochs, with losses for both Discriminator and Generator computed and accumulated to monitor and guide the training process.

This project aims to provide insights into the practical implementation of GANs using PyTorch, emphasizing key aspects such as network architecture, data handling, and optimization techniques. The result is a trained GAN capable of generating realistic handwritten digit images from random noise.


**Setting Up the Environment**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Before diving into building a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), it’s essential to set up the development environment. This includes installing necessary libraries and frameworks that will be used throughout the project and configuration parameters needed for training our Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

```python
import torch
torch.manual_seed(42)
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from tqdm.notebook import tqdm
```

**Configurations**

```python
device = 'cuda' #image = image.to(device)

batch_size = 128 # trianloader, training loop

noise_dim = 64 # generator model

# optimizer parameters

lr = 0.0002
beta_1 = 0.5
beta_2 = 0.99

# Training variables

epochs = 20
```
### Data Preparation and Augmentation

<p style="text-align: justify;">
With the environment set up and essential libraries imported, and configurations, we are now ready to move on to loading our dataset and defining the architecture of our GAN. we will be loading and preparing the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. We will use the torchvision library to download the dataset and apply necessary transformations to the images. Specifically, we'll augment the images with random rotations to introduce variability, which helps the model generalize better. Finally, we'll visualize one of the images from the dataset to ensure that our data is loaded and processed correctly.

**Data Description**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is preprocessed using the following steps:

```python
from torchvision import datasets, transforms as T

train_augs = T.Compose([
    T.RandomRotation((-20, +20)),
    T.ToTensor()
])

trainset = datasets.MNIST('MNIST/', download=True, train=True, transform=train_augs)
images, label = trainset[8900]

plt.imshow(images.squeeze(), cmap='gray')
print("Total images in trainset:", len(trainset))
```

**Load Dataset Into Batches**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
With the MNIST dataset successfully loaded and visualized, we now have our data ready for training. The next steps will involve organizing this data into batches and setting up data loaders, which will streamline the training process by feeding the data into the model efficiently.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We’ll use PyTorch’s DataLoader to batch and shuffle the data, ensuring efficient and randomized input during training. This section also includes a custom function, show_tensor_images, which will help us visualize a grid of images from a batch, allowing us to inspect the input data that our GAN will learn from.


```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision.utils import make_grid
```

```python
trainloader = DataLoader(trainset, batch_size = batch_size, shuffle = True)
```

```python
print("Total number od batches in trainloader : ", len(trainloader))
```

```python
dataiter = iter(trainloader)

images, _ = next(dataiter)

print(images.shape)
```

```python
# 'show_tensor_images' : function is used to plot some of images from the batch

def show_tensor_images(tensor_img, num_images = 16, size=(1, 28, 28)):
    unflat_img = tensor_img.detach().cpu()
    img_grid = make_grid(unflat_img[:num_images], nrow=4)
    plt.imshow(img_grid.permute(1, 2, 0).squeeze())
    plt.show()
```

```python
show_tensor_images(images, num_images = 16)
```

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This step ensures that our data is correctly formatted and ready for the training loop. Next will focus on building the architecture of our GAN, starting with the Discriminator and Generator networks. These networks will be trained using the batched data we’ve just prepared, moving us closer to our goal of generating realistic handwritten digit images.

#### Create Loss Function and Load Optimizer

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Now that we have defined our Generator and Discriminator models, it's time to set up the loss functions and optimizers that will guide their training. The Discriminator will use binary cross-entropy loss with logits (BCEWithLogitsLoss) to measure its performance. Specifically, when given real images, the Discriminator's loss function will compare its predictions to a ground truth of all ones, and when given fake images, it will compare to all zeros. These loss functions will help the Discriminator learn to distinguish between real and generated images effectively. We’ll also define optimizers for both models using Adam optimization, which is well-suited for deep learning tasks due to its adaptive learning rate.


```python
def real_loss(disc_pred):
  criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
  ground_truth = torch.ones_like(disc_pred)
  loss = criterion(disc_pred, ground_truth)
  return loss

def fake_loss(disc_pred):
  criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
  ground_truth = torch.zeros_like(disc_pred)
  loss = criterion(disc_pred, ground_truth)
  return loss
```

```python
D_opt = torch.optim.Adam(D.parameters(), lr = lr, betas = (beta_1, beta_2))
G_opt = torch.optim.Adam(G.parameters(), lr = lr, betas = (beta_1, beta_2))
```

<p style="text-align: justify;">
With the loss functions and optimizers defined, we are now ready to begin the training process. The loss functions will guide the Discriminator in distinguishing between real and fake images while helping the Generator learn to produce more realistic images. The Adam optimizer, with its carefully chosen hyperparameters, will ensure that both networks update their weights efficiently during training. In the next step, we will set up the training loop, where these components will work together to iteratively improve the Generator’s ability to fool the Discriminator and, ultimately, generate convincing images.


#### Training Loop

```python
# Training Loop
for i in range(epochs):
  
  # Initialize total losses for the epoch
  total_d_loss = 0.0
  total_g_loss = 0.0

  # Iterate over each batch in the training loader
  for real_img, _ in trainloader:

    # Move real images to the appropriate device
    real_img = real_img.to(device)
    # Generate random noise for the Generator
    noise = torch.randn(batch_size, noise_dim, device=device)

    # --------------------- Train the Discriminator ---------------------

    # Zero the gradients for the Discriminator
    D_opt.zero_grad()

    # Generate fake images using the Generator
    fake_img = G(noise)
    # Get Discriminator's prediction for fake images
    D_pred = D(fake_img)
    # Calculate loss for fake images
    D_fake_loss = fake_loss(D_pred)

    # Get Discriminator's prediction for real images
    D_pred = D(real_img)
    # Calculate loss for real images
    D_real_loss = real_loss(D_pred)

    # Compute the average loss for the Discriminator
    D_loss = (D_fake_loss + D_real_loss) / 2

    # Accumulate Discriminator's loss for the epoch
    total_d_loss += D_loss.item()

    # Backpropagate the loss and update Discriminator's weights
    D_loss.backward()
    D_opt.step()

    # --------------------- Train the Generator ---------------------

    # Zero the gradients for the Generator
    G_opt.zero_grad()

    # Generate new random noise for the Generator
    noise = torch.randn(batch_size, noise_dim, device=device)

    # Generate fake images using the Generator
    fake_img = G(noise)
    # Get Discriminator's prediction for fake images
    D_pred = D(fake_img)
    # Calculate Generator's loss based on Discriminator's predictions
    G_loss = real_loss(D_pred)

    # Accumulate Generator's loss for the epoch
    total_g_loss += G_loss.item()

    # Backpropagate the loss and update Generator's weights
    G_l
```

```python
# Run after training is completed.
# Now you can use Generator Network to generate handwritten images

noise = torch.randn(batch_size, noise_dim, device = device)
generated_image = G(noise)

show_tensor_images(generated_image)
```

1. **Generator Performance**:
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   - The Generator progressively improved its ability to produce handwritten digit images that visually resemble those in the MNIST dataset. Early generated images displayed noticeable artifacts and lacked clarity, but as training progressed, the images became more coherent and closer to actual MNIST digits.

2. **Discriminator Performance**:
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   - The Discriminator effectively learned to differentiate between real MNIST images and those generated by the Generator. Initially, the Discriminator showed high accuracy in classifying real versus fake images, but as the Generator improved, the Discriminator's accuracy fluctuated, reflecting the adversarial nature of the training process.

3. **Loss Metrics**:
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   - Loss values for both the Generator and Discriminator were monitored throughout the training process. The Discriminator's loss decreased over time, indicating improved classification capabilities, while the Generator's loss showed a downward trend as it generated more realistic images.

4. **Visual Output**:
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   - Images generated by the trained Generator were visually inspected at various stages of training. The final generated images displayed significant improvement in quality, with well-defined handwritten digits that closely resembled those in the MNIST dataset.
